# Philips SICP Python & Home Assistant

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Philips Signage Control Protocol (SICP) called [SICPpy](src/sicppy/README.md) and a Home Assistant integration using it [sicp_homeassistant](src/sicp_homeassistant/README.md).

SICPpy also exposes a CLI to quickly interact with Philips Signage devices, as well as a programmatic API for building custom applications.

## Requirements for CLI
+ [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) package manager
